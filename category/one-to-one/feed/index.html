				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I so whole-heartedly agree with the increased coverage that “mental health” is getting in the media at the moment.  Teresa May has said this morning that she wanted to tackle the “despicable stigma” of those with mental health conditions as part of her vision of a “shared society” …don’t worry!  I will never get all political with you, so moving on…</p>
<p>The Royals, William, Harry &amp; Kate are also making huge in-roads into taking away this stigma, with particular attention to the suffering of our servicemen, which is a very effective way of making the discussion more mainstream, as most of us feel very strongly about our Armed Forces and the sacrifices they make for us.</p>
<p>But what I think every time I hear it mentioned is that WE ALL HAVE MENTAL HEALTH… Some of us have good mental health and others have serious mental health illnesses, but we should all pay close attention to our own mental health throughout our lives.</p>
<p>At this time of year, we are all thinking about New Year’s Resolutions, which can often involve rushing to the gym (or at least rushing to join the gym!), or starting the latest diet and other such things that help maintain our “physical health”, but not many of us think about how we should maintain our mental health.  This usually only happens when your mental health starts to suffer.</p>
<p>Good mental health can be maintained by building resilience – we can never stop bad external events happening to us in life, that is not within our control, so we need to help the things we can control.  Resilience can be built by filling your “happy bucket” as much as possible in the good times (imagine a bucket with a tap at the bottom, come on, do it…stay with me…it will make sense in a minute), so that when we are hit with hard times (I know I’m making this sound simple – again, bear with!) and the “happy stuff” starts to drain out of the bottom of your happy bucket, you will find you have reserves there so that the bucket doesn’t empty completely.  An empty bucket means no resilience and defences against the stress of difficult circumstances, leading to a breakdown in mental health wellbeing.</p>
<p>Filling your happy bucket can mean something as simple as; spending time with good friends, taking time out for “me-time”, exercise, a long bath!  Airplane spotting if that’s what floats your boat and leads to enjoyment and relaxation.</p>
<p>Talking therapies are also great for all of us!  The British (myself included obviously) are not quite so enthusiastic about these things as our American friends, but it is growing in the UK, interventions such as coaching are about forward positive movement in your life, setting and reaching goals, leading the life you want to have, building the business you want to have, maintaining the health you want &#8230; whatever!  If you put your focus on a certain area, it tends to have an effect, and magically things start to happen.</p>
<p>Now I know you’re thinking I’m just trying to sell you my coaching services, but honestly, I’m not (ok well maybe I am a bit).  I am passionate about talking to people, I love hearing their stories, their wishes and dreams etc. (not all fluffy ones, I love the new business dreams and goals especially!).  We all would benefit so much from taking a small amount of time out every so often to think about us, ourselves!  Getting to know yourself, how you work best, what you can and can’t do, what you do and don’t like, what is important to you, shaking off fear of failure, increasing your confidence etc.  How often do we really take the time out to think about these things?  (Well in my life quite a lot actually! But hey I’m a Coach, it’s what I do).</p>
<p>Getting back to looking after our physical health, of course this is really important, but I believe looking after our mental health is much more important – if you lose that, you won’t want, or perhaps not be able to look after your physical health, and your physical health is intrinsically linked to your mental health anyway.</p>
<p>So, let’s forget the stigma, for those of us who have been lucky enough to have good mental health through our lives, we still need to be aware that it is something that needs to be looked after just like that slightly-fatter post Christmas body of some (yes me included!).  It’s just not so visually obvious.  Mental health illnesses can affect any of us at any time.</p>
<p>If nothing else, it’s a lot more fun filling up your happy bucket by sitting and talking to your most favourite Coach (that’s me!) than sweating your b******s off at the gym!</p>
<p>Just Saying!</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-family: 'Open Sans',sans-serif;"><span style="color: #000000; font-size: medium;">I don’t know about you but I treat holidays a little like New Year’s Eve, it’s a great time to set new resolutions, new goals and think about what you really want to do next.</span></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Open Sans',sans-serif;"><span style="color: #000000; font-size: medium;"> </span></span><span style="font-family: 'Open Sans',sans-serif;"><span style="color: #000000; font-size: medium;">Sitting on a beach with either a great book or your headphones in listening to music, while watching the world around you enjoy themselves, children running in and out of the ocean, building sandcastles, with concentration etched on their faces is lovely to watch (especially when they aren’t your children to worry about!), but also I find myself thinking about how I can improve on things, what exciting new projects do I want to start etc……you don’t always have time to do this kind of thinking during normal day to day life.</span></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Open Sans',sans-serif;"><span style="color: #000000; font-size: medium;"> </span></span><span style="font-family: 'Open Sans',sans-serif;"><span style="color: #000000; font-size: medium;">We are all so busy these days, and when we aren’t a lot of us are addicted to the stimulus from our phones and tablets – we very rarely nowadays just sit and think.  I can’t even stand in a queue for over a minute without getting my phone out of my bag and catching up with either social media or the latest news.</span></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Open Sans',sans-serif;"><span style="color: #000000; font-size: medium;"> </span></span><span style="font-family: 'Open Sans',sans-serif;"><span style="color: #000000; font-size: medium;">So while sitting on the beach, I came up with a few goals for myself….the obvious one being….I want to lose the half stone I’ve put on during the holiday (I know it will be half a stone without looking on the scales when I get home).</span></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Open Sans',sans-serif;"><span style="color: #000000; font-size: medium;"> </span></span><span style="font-family: 'Open Sans',sans-serif;"><span style="color: #000000; font-size: medium;">Over the last two years I have studied a lot about human behaviour so I’m eager to try a few techniques out on myself – especially with regards to will power, habit forming and goal setting.  I’m starting with the advantage of feeling refreshed and restored after the holiday, so I’m giving myself a good fighting chance of success!</span></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Open Sans',sans-serif;"><span style="color: #000000; font-size: medium;"> </span></span><span style="font-family: 'Open Sans',sans-serif;"><span style="color: #000000; font-size: medium;">So my starting point is finding my motivation – something exciting and inspiring – I know…our next holiday!  Not till November but having spent 11 days looking at toned bodies in bikinis I want that too – I want to be able to feel comfortable and confident when I next step out on the beach.  So that will be what I will remind myself of on a daily basis – I’ve started writing a journal so each morning I wake up and write down how I feel the day before went, what could I improve on (try not to drink too much Pinot Grigio when out for dinner, keeping away from my mum’s Chocolate Biscuit Cake….that sort of thing) and then write small achievable goals – not too many negatives – but words of encouragement that might help me when I’m losing that motivation and will power.</span></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Open Sans',sans-serif;"><span style="color: #000000; font-size: medium;"> </span></span><span style="font-family: 'Open Sans',sans-serif;"><span style="color: #000000; font-size: medium;">I love stationery so writing a journal is a joy for me….in fact I can’t start anything new in my life without buying new stationery (whether necessary or not)!</span></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Open Sans',sans-serif;"><span style="color: #000000; font-size: medium;"> </span></span><span style="font-family: 'Open Sans',sans-serif;"><span style="color: #000000; font-size: medium;">It’s all about planning too – we all know ourselves well and we know what will lead us astray.  So this year (a first I have to say) I booked a training session for the morning after I get back from holiday – I knew that if I didn’t I would take two weeks to get back in the “zone”.  </span></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Open Sans',sans-serif;"><span style="color: #000000; font-size: medium;"> </span></span><span style="font-family: 'Open Sans',sans-serif;"><span style="color: #000000; font-size: medium;">I remind myself that I really really really want this goal – think of those bodies on the beach and think that is what I’m going to have!!!  I know I’ll probably put on half a stone on the next holiday but I’ll do it mindfully and knowing that I’m making the most of a great relaxing holiday but I’ve got the motivation and skills to get back into the zone when I get home!</span></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Open Sans',sans-serif;"><span style="color: #000000; font-size: medium;"> </span></span><span style="font-family: 'Open Sans',sans-serif;"><span style="color: #000000; font-size: medium;">The feeling that you get once you have achieved a goal is fantastic and acts as motivation for you to achieve the next one……so the answer is obviously….take more holidays so you have more time to think of more goals!</span></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Open Sans',sans-serif;"><span style="color: #000000; font-size: medium;"> </span></span><span style="font-family: 'Open Sans',sans-serif;"><span style="color: #000000; font-size: medium;">2</span><sup><span style="color: #000000; font-size: small;">nd</span></sup><span style="color: #000000; font-size: medium;"> August 2016</span></span></p>
